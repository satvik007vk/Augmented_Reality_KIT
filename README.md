### Welcome to our Augmented Reality Project. This is a mini tour guide for the portraits in Jordan Hall at KIT. <more info later>

## Working on the code
After cloning the repository, run: <br>
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
This will create a conda environment and install dependencies <br>

Then, activate the environment using: <br>
`conda activate ar_kit`

### Structure:
Most user interaction happens in the `main.ipynb` file, run it to generate the output and/or give your input.
Other python files contains classes and methods which are called in the `main.ipynb` file.

### Adding your contribution:
To contribute, create a new branch (`git checkout -b <branch_name>`).<br>
To add/modify a functionality, add/modify your own python (.py) files and then import those in the `main.ipynb` <br>
Then commit and push your changes your branch. 
Go to the Github repo in your browser, and create a pull/merge request to merge your branch to main.

Happy Coding!
