### Welcome to our Augmented Reality Project. This is a mini tour guide for the portraits in Jordan Hall at KIT. <more info later>

## Working on the code
After cloning the repository, run: <br>
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
This will create a conda environment and install dependencies <br>

Then, activate the environment using: <br>
`conda activate ar_kit`

To contribute, create a new branch (`git checkout -b <branch_name>`), and push to main.
